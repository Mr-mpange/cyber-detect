### Performance Results

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
| Random Forest | 0.9215 | 0.9808 | 0.6265 | 0.7646 | 0.8396 |
| SVM | 0.9135 | 1.0000 | 0.5749 | 0.7301 | 0.8342 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.9220 | 0.9960 | 0.6192 | 0.7636 | 0.8441 |
| Neural Network | 0.8805 | 0.7386 | 0.6388 | 0.6851 | 0.8229 |
| Isolation Forest | 0.7920 | 0.4803 | 0.2703 | 0.3459 | N/A |


### Key Findings

#### Why Recall is Critical in Cybersecurity:
- **High recall ensures maximum attack detection** - Missing a real attack (false negative) can be catastrophic
- **False positives are manageable** - Security teams can investigate false alarms, but missed attacks cause damage
- **Cost asymmetry** - The cost of missing an attack far exceeds the cost of investigating a false positive

#### Model Recommendations:
- **Best Overall Performance**: Based on F1-score for balanced precision-recall trade-off
- **Best for Security**: Model with highest recall for maximum attack detection
- **Production Deployment**: Consider ensemble of top-performing models

### Technical Implementation

#### System Architecture:
```
Raw Network Data -> Data Preprocessing -> Feature Engineering -> ML Models -> Attack Classification
```

#### Key Features Used:
- Flow duration and packet statistics
- Byte and packet rates
- Inter-arrival time statistics
- Forward/backward packet characteristics

### Limitations and Future Work

#### Current Limitations:
- Binary classification (Normal vs Attack) - could be extended to multi-class
- Simulated data for demonstration - real-world deployment needs actual network data
- Static model - could benefit from online learning for evolving threats

#### Future Enhancements:
- Real-time processing pipeline
- Deep learning models (LSTM, CNN) for sequential pattern analysis
- Ensemble methods combining multiple algorithms
- Integration with network monitoring tools
- Automated model retraining pipeline
